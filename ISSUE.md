# Implement Hero Banner on Landing Page

## Description
Add a hero banner section to the landing page with default call-to-action buttons.

## Requirements
- Create a hero banner as the first element in the landing page that occupies the full width of the screen
- The hero banner should:
  - Have a visually appealing background (either an image or a gradient)
  - Include a compelling headline that introduces the purpose of the site
  - Include a brief subheading or description
  - Feature at least two call-to-action buttons (e.g., "Get Started", "Learn More")
- The hero banner should be responsive and look good on all screen sizes
- The hero banner should maintain the application's theme support (dark/light mode)
- The styling should be consistent with the existing application style

## Technical Considerations
- Implement within the existing React component structure
- Update the CSS to accommodate the new hero section
- Ensure that the existing theme toggle functionality works with the new hero banner
- Possibly refactor the current structure to better accommodate a landing page layout
- Use responsive design principles to ensure it works well on mobile, tablet, and desktop

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Hero banner is visible at the top of the landing page
- [ ] Banner includes headline, subheading, and call-to-action buttons
- [ ] Banner properly adjusts to screen size (responsive design)
- [ ] Dark/light theme switching is properly applied to the banner
- [ ] Layout and design are visually appealing and professional

## Additional Notes
This is a learning exercise to enhance the front-end development skills. Code will be implemented by the assignee as a learning opportunity.
